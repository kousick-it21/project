    <h2>Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat(domnic toreto)</h2>
    <p>One look at the 2023 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and you know that this four-door sedan is something very different. 
       The current-generation Charger debuted for the 2005 model year, and since then Dodge has strapped more and more powerful engines to its chassis. 
       A supercharged V-8 engine is under the hood of the latest versions and it makes at least 717 horsepower. 
       Opt for a Redeye model and horsepower is boosted to 797—and with the Jailbreak package that number is an even more insane 807 ponies. 
       While the Charger SRT Hellcat is more at home at a drag strip than on a road course it actually holds its own in corners, something we proved years ago at our Lightning Lap event. 
       Its monstrous acceleration puts it in league with high-dollar rivals such as the Mercedes-AMG GT63 S and Porsche Panamera Turbo S, but the Hellcat’s down-market cabin isn’t anything like those luxury models’. 
       Still, if you’re looking for a muscle car with room for the kiddies—and the performance to make them giggle and shout—the Hellcat is one guaranteed thrill ride.</p>

    <h2>SUPRA(paul walker)</h2>
    <p>The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.
       [4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.
       [5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra.
       [6] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, 
       second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. 
       The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.</p>

    <h2>Boss 429 Mustang(jhon wick)</h2>
    <p>The Boss 429 is recognized as being among some of the rarest and highly valued muscle cars to date.
       [1] In total there were 1359 original Boss 429s made. 
       The origin of the Boss 429 was to fulfil Ford's need to homologate the 429 semi-hemispherical engine for NASCAR racing. 
       Ford was seeking to develop an engine that would better compete with the 426 Hemi from Chrysler in NASCAR's Grand National Division, 
       now known as the NASCAR Cup Series. NASCAR's homologation rules required that at least 500 cars be fitted with this motor and sold to the general public. 
       After much consideration, it was decided by Ford that the Mustang would be the car that would house this new engine.</p>
